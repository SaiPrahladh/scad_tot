# Docker Installation

Installing the docker image will be the quickest way to setup the project for most users.

## Prerequisites

* You'll need [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed. So, install that first if you don't have it already.

## Installation

* Pull the image: `docker pull grese/scad_tot`

## Usage

* Start the container: `docker run -it grese/scad_tot /bin/zsh`
